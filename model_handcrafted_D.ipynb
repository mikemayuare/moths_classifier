However, increasing the number of layers and filters in a CNN model should be done with caution to prevent overfitting to the training data. We already applied regularization with droputs layers and data augmentation. Larger models with more parameters may require more computational resources and longer training times, which can be a limitation in practical applications.\n","\n","In this model with added and extra Conv2D layer per block and a fully connected Dense layer of 256 units.\n","\n","The model performed very well, nevertheless, the added cost must be weighted considering that the dataset is small and the model C performed slightly worse with lower complexity."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"G2ugobkPu2o-","tags":[],"outputId":"9e73091a-ed5c-405b-ac9f-0fb2492b56b3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["2023-04-08 20:27:08.932566: I tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_feature_guard.cc:182] This TensorFlow binary is optimized to use available CPU instructions in performance-critical operations.\n","To enable the following instructions: AVX2 FMA, in other operations, rebuild TensorFlow with the appropriate compiler flags.\n","2023-04-08 20:27:09.495490: W tensorflow/compiler/tf2tensorrt/utils/py_utils.cc:38] TF-TRT Warning: Could not find TensorRT\n"]}],"source":["# Make the imports\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","from tensorflow.keras import layers, initializers\n","from tensorflow.keras.models import load_model\n","from tensorflow.keras.utils import image_dataset_from_directory\n","\n","import plotly.express as px\n","from plotly.subplots import make_subplots\n","import pandas as pd\n","from math import floor\n","\n","import pathlib"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"yilmaPlSpSbK"},"outputs":[],"source":["# get the data\n","!wget https://www.dropbox.com/s/n3320qxwdn3rs19/moths.zip?dl=0 -O moths.zip\n","!unzip moths.zip"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"jr7icHxjyLz7"},"source":["First, the previous model is imported in order to make the necessary modifications."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"CtZGNf0Pze4S"},"source":["A new model can be developed from scratch using this model as template."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"Idn0iiUnz3Py","tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["def model_D(blocks=4, input_shape=(224, 224, 3)):\n","    data_augmentation = keras.Sequential([\n","        layers.RandomRotation(0.2), \n","        layers.RandomFlip(),\n","        layers.RandomContrast(0.2),\n","        layers.RandomBrightness(0.2),\n","        layers.RandomZoom(0.1),\n","    ])\n","\n","    inputs = keras.Input(shape=input_shape)\n","    x = data_augmentation(inputs)\n","    x = layers.Rescaling(1./255)(x)\n","    for i in range(blocks + 1, blocks + 5):\n","        x = layers.Conv2D(filters=2**i, kernel_size=3, padding=\"same\",\n","                          kernel_initializer=initializers.GlorotNormal(seed=123), \n","                          activation=\"relu\")(x)\n","        residual = x\n","        x = layers.Conv2D(filters=2**i, kernel_size=3, padding=\"same\",\n","                          kernel_initializer=initializers.GlorotNormal(seed=123), \n","                          activation=\"relu\")(x)\n","        x = layers.MaxPooling2D(pool_size=2, padding=\"same\")(x)\n","        residual = layers.Conv2D(2**i, 1, strides=2)(residual)\n","        x = layers.add([x, residual])\n","        x = layers.Dropout(0.3)(x)\n","    residual = x\n","    x = layers.Conv2D(filters=256, kernel_size=3, \n","                      activation=\"relu\", padding=\"same\")(x)\n","    residual = layers.Conv2D(2**i, 1, strides=2)(residual)\n","    x = layers.Flatten()(x)\n","    x = layers.Dropout(0.5)(x)\n","    x = layers.Dense(256, activation='relu')(x)\n","    outputs = layers.Dense(30, activation=\"softmax\")(x)\n","    model = keras.Model(inputs=inputs, outputs=outputs)\n","    return model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"8Nvv8J_41iBJ","outputId":"22801e54-3e73-4af6-e4d1-34adfc44163c","tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["2023-04-08 19:38:23.249875: I tensorflow/compiler/xla/stream_executor/cuda/cuda_gpu_executor.cc:996] successful NUMA node read from SysFS had negative value (-1), but there must be at least one NUMA node, so returning NUMA node zero.
