By increasing the size and diversity of the training set, data augmentation can improve the model's generalization performance and reduce overfitting. A wide range of transformations can be applied, including rotations, translations, flips, zooms, and color distortions. Data augmentation is particularly effective when the training set is limited or imbalanced, as it can help the model learn more robust and discriminative features from the available data. There have been numerous studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of data augmentation for improving the performance of deep neural networks.\n","\n","In our dataset it effect was clearly positive, with little overfiting during training.\n","\n","*Perez, L., & Wang, J.
